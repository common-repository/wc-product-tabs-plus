== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are not all of my global tabs being displayed under Product edit screen? =

It's probably because you have cloned/drafted a global tab from the Global Tabs table listing. When you clone, the unique field ID of the tab remains the same and as it is no longer unique it will fail to be listed in the Global Tabs on product edit screen. To make sure a new (unique) Field ID is generated, always use the "Add new" button to create new tabs.

= I have mistakenly deleted my tab. How can I get it back? =

Deletion only happens at the HTML DOM level within the Product backend page i.e. it is a soft delete which does not remove the data from the database until you save the Product. So if you delete one accidentally, you can just refresh the page and have it back.

= Why are some of my tabs not being displayed in the frontend =

The Tab title is a required field for all tabs. If you leave it blank the tab will not be not be displayed in the frontend.

= Can I modify the default WooCommerce tabs, like Reviews, Description? =

No, the plugin only manages it's own Tabs.
